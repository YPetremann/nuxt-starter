# Content Directory

The Nuxt Content module reads the content/ directory in your project and parses .md, .yml, .csv and
.json files to create a file-based CMS for your application.

- Render your content with built-in components.
- Query your content with a MongoDB-like API.
- Use your Vue components in Markdown files with the MDC syntax.
- Automatically generate your navigation.
