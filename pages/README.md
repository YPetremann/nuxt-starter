# Pages Directory

Nuxt provides a file-based routing to create routes within your web application using Vue Router
under the hood.

This directory is optional, meaning that vue-router won't be included if you only use app.vue
(unless you set pages: true in nuxt.config or have a app/router.options.ts), reducing your
application's bundle size.
